              <p>Absolutely. The Adobe Express app is quick and easy to use on smartphones and other mobile devices. 
                Simply open the QR code generator, add your desired link, choose a style and color, download the file, and you're done.
                 With Adobe Express, there's no need to create an account or sign in before you start.</p>

                  <p>Unlike on some QR code generator sites that only offer a free trial, QR codes generated in Adobe Express don’t expire. The app is free and easy to use, so you can make any number of QR codes for your online services, websites, or products and add them to posters, forms, and flyers. QR codes are as important as logos; try one on your business card or vCard – it's much easier for someone to scan than remember a mobile phone number or lengthy URLs.</p>

                  <p className='hlo'>A QR code is similar to a barcode, but it holds much more data and many different characters (not only the English language). Everything that has a link (URL) on the internet, be it your blog articles, portfolio images, YouTube channel, LinkedIn profile, Instagram account, customer order form or business location can be turned into a QR code. People scan the QR code with their mobile phone or device to access your information, from reviews or payment pages to product information and exclusive offers.</p>
